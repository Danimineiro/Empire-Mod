# Empire-Mod
The repository for the empire mod for rimworld
Empire mod is a mod for Ludeon Studio's topdown base building-exploration game Rimworld.
It adds the ability to found your own empire and have colonies not controlled by you give you silver and items, as well as provide you with troops.
This mod was initially developed by Saakra, a lone Mod Dev. He has since moved on due to IRL issues and handed over the reigns of development to me and Shalax.

Building
To build using the dotnet cli, go to (version folder) and run

dotnet build --configuration release

The Assembly will output to the Assemblies folder. 
Debug symbols will only be included on the debug configuration, 
which requires RimWorldData_(version) copied from the vanilla game.
